# Orthorubulavirus_HPIV
This repository contains the analysis described in the article.

The NCBI accession numbers and associated metadata for HPIV-2, HPIV-4 and Mumps virus genomes can be found in the tree files:
Maximum likelihood trees using IQ-TREE have the file extension .treefile.
Bayesian phylodynamic trees using BEAST2 have the file extension .tre, and details of each run are indicated in the .xml file.
BEAST2 analysis by gene partitions have the file extension .log

To visualize the trees, you can use software such as FigTree. When importing the trees, you can also include the corresponding annotation files: . These annotation files will enable you to display the metadata within the trees.

Table HPIV-2_p-distance.xlsx contains estimates of p-distance over sequence pairs between genotypes with MEGAX, for the purpose of confirming HPIV-2 genotypes.
